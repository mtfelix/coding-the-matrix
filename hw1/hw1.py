## Problem 4
# Please express your solution as a set of the letters corresponding to the solutions.
# For example, {'a','b','c'} is the subset consisting of:
#   a (1100000), b (0110000), and c (0011000).
# Leave an empty set if it cannot be expressed in terms of the other vectors.

## Problem 5
# Use the same format as the previous problem
